    👋 Hello! I'm <strong>Mario</strong> and this is my personal website.
  </p>
  </p>
    I <a href="/posts/">post</a> random thoughts on computer/web programming, digital self-reliance, travel/location independence, and personal finance/investing. 
  </p>  
    
  <h2>🕰️ Now</h2>
  <p>
    I am using what I've learned about web development to improve this site, and I started blogging again. I am also planning my next <a href="/photos/">trips</a> with the intention of spending at least 30% of 2023 abroad, and exploring investing in different fintech platforms. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also learning different open source web development technologies to replace software and solutions built by large corporations. 
  </p>
 
  <h2>🔗 About This Site</h2>
  <p>
    This site is built with a static site generator called <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. I write posts in Markdown, run the command <code>hugo</code> from the terminal command line, and watch as Hugo generates the HTML files that I can then deploy to a server in the open web. All you need for a setup like this is to download Hugo and have access to the Linux terminal and a text editor (such as <a href="/posts/vim">Vim</a>).
