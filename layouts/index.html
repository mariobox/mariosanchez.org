      <h5 style="font-weight: 600">How it Works</h5>
      <p>I am available for online and in-person classes. Online classes are conducted via the
        <a href="https://www.wyzant.com/refer/tutor/89013474">Wyzant</a> platform. Ideally, students will contact me
        before the class to let me know what
        subjects they need help with (either the general topics or the specific exercises they
        want us to review together).
      </p>
      <p>
        During our lessons I ensure that students understand the concepts behind the solutions
        to problems, so that they can later apply them themselves.

      <h5 style="font-weight: 600">Teaching Style</h5>

      <p>
        My experience in teaching comes not from a traditional education background, but from
        the corporate world. As an Industrial Engineer and MBA, one of my most important tasks
        was to give presentations that required me to distill and simplify complex concepts,
        while keeping my audience engaged. I am now using those same skills in my math tutoring
        sessions.</p>
      <p>
        I also draw inspiration from my computer programming journey, since computational
        thinking-the logical and process-oriented approach to solving problems, lends itself
        naturally to the teaching of math.</p>


      <p>
        I firmly believe that math is not difficult: it is just poorly taught. During my
        tutoring sessions I make sure that my students master the basics first. I also use
        examples to make the concepts less abstract and easier to understand. </p>

      <p>My goal is to help students overcome their fear of math, enjoy the learning process, and
        do well in class and tests.
