    👋 Hello! My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and this is my personal website.
  </p>
  </p>
 I post random thoughts on computer/web programming, digital self-reliance, travel/location independence, and personal finance/investing. 
  </p>  
    
  <h2>🕰️ Now</h2>
  <p>
    I am using my web development skills to build and improve this site. I am also planning my next <a href="/photos/">trips</a> with the intention of spending at least 30% of 2023 abroad, and exploring investing in diversified fintech real estate platforms. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also learning different open source web development technologies to replace software and solutions built by large corporations. 
  </p>
 
  <h2>🔗About This Site</h2>
  <p>
    This site is built with a static site generator called <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. I write posts in Markdown, run the command <code>hugo</code> from the terminal command line, and watch as Hugo generates the HTML files that I can then deploy to a server in the open web. All you need for a setup like this is to download Hugo and have access to the Linux terminal and the text editor <a href="https://vim.org">Vim</a>, both open source tools that have been around for decades.
