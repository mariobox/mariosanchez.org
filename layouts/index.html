    👋 Hello! My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong>. I am currently redesigning this site to better reflect my current activities and priorities. 
  </p>  
    
  <h2>🕰️ Now</h2>
  <p>
    I am taking a break from learning computer programming and web development, which was my focus for the last year or so. I felt that I had already learned what I needed in order to do what I wanted to do, 
    and felt ready to move to other things that are taking priority in my life right now. 
  <p>I'll be making some changes to the site, write about things that I'm learning and doing now, and transform this 
    site into a public diary of sorts that I can use to organize my thoughts and activities, and hopefully build some accountability to myself for the things I want to accomplish. More to come soon.
  </p>
