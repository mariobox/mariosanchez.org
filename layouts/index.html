      <h5 style="font-weight: 600">How it Works</h5>
      <p>I am available for online classes only. Lessons are conducted via <a href="https://meet.google.com/landing">Google Meet</a>. Ideally, students will contact me
        before the class to let me know what subjects they need help with (either the general topics or the specific exercises they
        want us to review together).

      <p>
        My knowledge of math comes from a strong background in Industrial Engineering and an MBA in business.
        My experience in teaching comes not from a traditional education background, but from
        the corporate world. As a product manager, I often had to give presentations to a non-technical audience,
        which required me to distill and simplify complex concepts in a way that everybody could understand. 
        I am now using those same skills in my math tutoring sessions.</p>
      <p>
        I also draw inspiration from my computer programming journey. I've found that computational
        thinking-the logical and process-oriented approach to solving problems, lends itself
        naturally to the teaching of math.</p>

      <p>
        I firmly believe that math is not difficult: it is just poorly taught. During my
        tutoring sessions I guide students to first develop an intuition for how a problem could be solved,
        using tools like tables and graphs. I then go through the different building blocks
        and techniques that can be used to solve the problem, making sure that the student understands why each of them makes sense.</p>

      <p>My goal is to help students overcome their fear of math, enjoy the learning process, and
        do well in class and tests.
