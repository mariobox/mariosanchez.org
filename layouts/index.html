    My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and this is my personal website. I am a hobbyist web developer and I created this site to document and practice what I learn.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from web developing and programming, I like to tinker with old computers, read non-fiction (mostly microeconomics, finance, phsycology and marketing), bike riding and watching good soccer. This is what I'm doing <a href="/now/">now</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My presence on social media is almost non-existent, although I still use Twitter occasionally. I don't have a Facebook profile.
