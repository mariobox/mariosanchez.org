    My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and this is my personal website. I am a junior web developer, and I created this site to document and practice what I learn.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from <strong>web developing and programming</strong> I like tinkering with old computers, investing, marketing, bike riding and good soccer.
