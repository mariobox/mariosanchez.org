    My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and this is my personal website. I am a junior web developer, and I created <a href="/post/site/">this site</a> to document and practice what I learn.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from <strong>web developing and programming</strong> I like old computers, investing, marketing, bike riding and good soccer. These are my <a href="/now/">/now</a> page and my <a href="/uses/">/uses</a> page. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My presence on social media is almost non-existent, although I still use Twitter occasionally. I don't have a Facebook profile.
