    My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong>. I am a hobbyist web developer, programmer and sysadmin, and I created this website as a repository of my notes and practice projects.

  <h2>About This Site</h2>
  <p>
    This site is generated with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, a static site generator written in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>, that prides itself of being the world's fastest framework for building websites. <strong>Hugo</strong> enjoys active community support, so the likelihood of having to deal with stale dependencies in the future is very small. Of all the platforms I've used so far, Hugo has been the fastest and most reliable.
  </p>
  <p>
    I run a hand-coded <a href="/css/minimal.css">CSS style sheet</a> optimized for speed, that provides the look and feel of a text editor from the early days of computing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, This site doesn't run Google Analytics or any other tracking software, and there are no affiliate links. It is served over <a href="/post/https/">HTTPS</a> to ensure all traffic is encrypted.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently hosting the site in <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> which comes with HTTPS and custom domain support. In the past, I've hosed the site in a Digital Ocean virtual private server, but Github Pages seems like a better option for a simple static site.
  </p>  

  <h2>Others</h2>
  <p>
    I've created a <a href="/uses/">Uses</a> page, inspired by Wes Bos's <a href="https://uses.tech">uses.tech</a> project, to list the main technologies I am using for web development.
  </p>
  <p>I've also created a <a href="/now/">Now</a> page, inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Derek Sivers</a>, to give a short update of what I'm up to these days.</p>
