    👋 Hello! My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and this is my personal website.
  </p>
  </p>
 I post random thoughts on computer/web programming, digital self-reliance, travel/location independence, and personal finance/investing. 
  </p>  
    
  <h2>🕰️ Now</h2>
  <p>
    I am using my web development skills to build and improve this site. I am also planning my next trips (with the idea of spending at least 30% of 2023 abroad), and exploring investing in diversified fintech real estate platforms. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also learning about different open source technologies, to replace software built by large corporations that don't have our best interests at heart. 
  </p>
 
  <h2>About This Site</h2>
  <p>
    This site is built with a static site generator called <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. I write posts in Markdown, run the command <code>hugo</code> from the terminal command line and watch as Hugo generates the HTML files that are then deployed to the open web using any server I choose. All I need is the Linux terminal and the text editor <a href="https://vim.org">Vim</a>, both open source tools that have been around for several decades.
  </p>
