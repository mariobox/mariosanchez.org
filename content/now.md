I am now focusing on my Math tutoring practice, helping students with Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry and SAT/ACT Math preparation. Visit my [tutor page](/tutor).

I am also working with [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

This year I also took on birding as a hobby. I became a member of the [Tropical Audubon Society](https://tropicalaudubon.org/) and participated in several birding expeditions around the South Florida area. I'm keeping a checklist of the species I see in [eBird](https://ebird.org). I am planning a birding trip to Peru for 2025.

I also started drinking yerba mate. I like the ritual of preparing the perfect gourd of mate, and the subtle boost of energy you get from it.
