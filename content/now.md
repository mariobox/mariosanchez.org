I am now focusing on my Math tutoring practice, helping students with Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry and SAT/ACT Math preparation. 

I am also practicing with [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

Not long ago I also took birding as a hobby. I became a member of the [Tropical Audubon Society](https://tropicalaudubon.org/) and participate in several birding expeditions around the South Florida area. I'm keeping a checklist of the species I see in [eBird](https://ebird.org/profile/Mzk1MTc2Nw/world). 

My lifestyle is now location-independent, with about half a year spent at home in Miami, and the other half in different cities and countries.

This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com) project.
