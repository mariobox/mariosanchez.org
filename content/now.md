I am currently taking courses toward the [Google IT Support Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=GoogleITSupport-JobResources&campaignid=386854095&adgroupid=1212761787890085&device=c&keyword=google%20it%20support&matchtype=p&network=o&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=&hide_mobile_promo&msclkid=dd405ee3c2aa10cf540b3e269bdbeaa9&utm_term=google%20it%20support&utm_content=Google%20IT%20Support%20Certificate%20Non%20Branded) at Coursera.

So far it's been a great introduction to concepts like Networking, Operating Systems and Systems Administration. 

I'm also planning on revamping this site to make it more user friendly and better show what I've been doing in the web development front.
