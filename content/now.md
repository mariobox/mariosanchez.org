I am currently focused on learning server side programming and databases, and have just completed the [Django For Everybody](https://coursera.org/share/0168b3865fa7c7107114726e339d71a6) certification at Coursera. I am now working on several Django practice projects, and working on improving this site.



Thanks to the great [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/nowff) for inspiring this page.
