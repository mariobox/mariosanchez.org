I am also experimenting with drinking yerba mate. I like the subtle boost of energy you get from slowly going through a liter or more of water poured into a gourd of yerba. I am also attracted by the ritual itself: the very detailed steps you need to follow to brew the perfect mate.

Finally, I am getting ready for my next trip to Europe, following our tradition of escaping from the hot and humid Miami summer months.
