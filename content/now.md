I am currently evaluating new opportunities after spending 25+ years in the corporate world working in product development, marketing, brand strategy and sales.

My main areas of interest are:

* Product development and sourcing
* Education
* Personal Finance
* Programming and Web Development

The ideal opportunity would be at the intersection of some of those areas of interest. 

Please feel free to contact me at: mario (at) mariosanchez (dot) org, or join my LinkdeIn network.

Thanks to the great [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/nowff) for inspiring this page.
