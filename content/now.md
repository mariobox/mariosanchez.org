I am currently learning [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

I am also focusing on my Math tutoring practice, helping students with Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry and SAT/ACT Math preparation. Visit my [tutor page](/tutor).

This year I also took on birding as a hobby. I became a member of the [Tropical Audubon Society](https://tropicalaudubon.org/) and participated in several birding expeditions around the South Florida area. I'm keeping a checklist of the species I see in [eBird](https://ebird.org). I am planning a birding trip to Peru for 2025.

I am also experimenting with drinking yerba mate. I like the subtle boost of energy you get from slowly going through a liter or more of water poured into a gourd of yerba. I am also attracted by the ritual itself: the very detailed steps you need to follow to brew the perfect mate.

Finally, I am getting ready for my next trip to Europe, following our tradition of escaping from the hot and humid Miami summer months.
