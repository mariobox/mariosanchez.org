I am currently immersed in the Web Development track at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/mariosc). In the last few days I've focused on learning Node and Express, understanding routes and middleware, and deploying a couple of [Node web apps](https://mariosanchezcarrion.com/) to a [virtual private server](https://m.do.co/c/b96aa4f9fdfd).

I have also been thinking about the impact the Coronavirus is having on many areas of our daily life, among them:

* **<abbr title="Working From Home">WFH</abbr>**: Eliminating my 2-3 hour commute has been a game changer, allowing me to get more work done while optimizing for health and family. Will WFH become mainstream?

* **Essential Workers**: I've gained a new appreciation for folks who perform thankless jobs like cleaning, delivering stuff, stocking shelves, caring for people, etc. In times like these we realize that we could very well do with less lawyers or hedge fund managers, but not without the **essential workers** that make our day-to-day rhythms possible. We need to pay our essential workers more.

* **Education**: While the online experiment hasn't worked out well at the elementary, middle and high school levels, college online education should become more ubiqutous. The cost of a traditional college education is hard to justify, and many are now asking themselves if it is worth it. Will colleges be able to afford their real estate and bloated payrolls in an era where students can do most of their learning online? My guess is that the top 10-15 universities will, while the rest will have to reinvent themselves or fold. Here are some [interesting thoughts](https://www.profgalloway.com/post-corona-higher-ed) on the subject from Prof. Galloway.

* **The Environment**: After only a few weeks of decreased activity, skies were clearer, rivers clean and transparent, and wildlife was reclaiming its space. Will we finally recognize that our actions *do* impact the environment? Will we finally start changing the way we live?

* **Health Care**: When 38 million people can become unemployed in a matter of days, does it make sense to keep tying health insurance to employment? Isn't it time to consider universal health insurance?

* **Retirement**: The median balance in a 401K account for people aged 60-69 is just $67K. Isn't it time to re-think retirement? Can ordinary people afford to have their retirement funds tied to stocks, when the stock market can drop 20%-30% in a matter of days? 

* **The Fed**: The Fed has created trillions of dollars out of thin air to "support the economy". While some money is going directly to people, most of it is going to prop up corporations, with little or no strings attached. One may start to question why do we pay taxes, or why do we have to accept the argument that "we can't afford" health care for all when the Fed can just create new money at will.

* **Price Reset**: Is an asset deflation period coming now that people have less money to spend? What would be the implications on the price of houses, stocks or big ticket items like cars? Will they become cheaper? Or, on the other hand, will Fed actions cause runaway inflation?

* **<abbr title="Universal Basic Income">UBI</abbr>**: Most likely many of the jobs that were lost will never come back. Even before the crisis, [labor force participation](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate) was already a low 63%. Now it's just 60%, with almost 20% of that number now unemployed. Hasn't the time come to consider Unviersal Basic Income?

* **Real Life Experiences**: This might be a contrarian view now that everybody is betting on a massive move online for most activities, but once the pandemic starts to wane off, could we possibly see a consumer shift toward activities that emphasize human contact, like live classes, movies, travel, concerts, etc.? Will we soon begin to experience tech-fatigue? Here's a [great article](https://reallifemag.com/home-screens/) on the subject.

* **Experts**: These days it is difficult to know who to trust. Everybody seems to have an agenda. Here's a group of health "experts" further undermining their reputation supporting [large gatherings of people when it fits their political agenda](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html). 

* **<abbr title="Do It Yourself">DIY</abbr>**: Now that we've spent months at home doing everything ourselves, will we keep our DIY streak alive in the future? Will we decide to build or fix more things at home, cook more often, do more things ourselves instead of hiring somebody? Will I ever go back to the barber shop now that I can give myself a pretty decent buzz cut?

What do you think? Any ideas?
