I consider myself a self-taught **junior web developer**. 

I picked up web development as a **serious hobby** about five years ago, but I've been fascinated by th world wide web since the mid 1990's. Back then, being able to share your thoughts with the world instantly and at virtually no cost was (and *still* is) mind-boggling to me. That was the promise of the Internet and the WWW in their early days. 

Since those early days, I've been trying to learn everything about the [technologies](https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/) that make the web work. 

I first started making websites with [Microsoft Frontpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) and hosting them in [Geocities](https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/geocities-archive-netscape-browser-first-web-suburbs-aol/580285/). Both Frontpage and Geocities endured their share of criticism and ridicule as the web evolved, but I still remember those years fondly, and apparently [I am not alone](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/).

Then I moved up to registering my own domains and uploading my sites to shared hosting services via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>. Then, when [Web 2.0](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-web-20/) came along, I learned to deploy [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) blogs and got into <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.  

Not much later, large platforms that came to be known as *social networks* entered the playing field and started to aggregate Internet traffic at a furious pace. I spent a couple of years getting acquainted with them, only to become disillusioned as they morphed into sophisticated [surveillance engines](https://nomasters.io/posts/nonparticipation/) built to spy and profit from their users. 

The **open** and **decentralized** web that I had grown to love had started to die.

Then, at around 2012, I heard a few prominent hackers [talk](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) about something called [static site generators](https://www.sitepoint.com/static-site-generators/), and how they made them rediscover the excitement of publishing a personal website and experimenting with the code. I decided to go back to basics and re-learn the fundamentals of *HTML* and *CSS*. Soon, I was designing web pages from scratch with just a text editor, a blank page and my bare hands. 

I was hooked.

I experimented with several static site generators, especially [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (my current setup). 

I then decided to approach coding and web development in a more structured way, beyond just building static site. I enrolled in [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), the online coding school, and [completed](https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion) their *Front End Web Development* and *JavaScript* tracks. I also took courses on a variety of subjects, like *React* and *Node*. I deeply enjoyed Treehouse's teaching style. 

I then took [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science), the Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard, offered by [edX](https://edx.org), where I learned about algorithms, *C*, *JavaScript* and back-end development with *Python*, *Flask* and *SQL*. In parallel, I also learned *Git* and deployed a few virtual private servers. That is pretty much where I am today.

As an [introvert](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) with a bias for logic and rational thinking, coding is an activity that matches my personality better than anything else I've tried-I just wish I had discovered it *earlier*. 

If you're just starting and think coding is something you may enjoy, I would suggest starting with [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) where you will learn the basics right. After that, you can keep learning specific languages, libraries and frameworks in sites like [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com), [CodeCademy](https://codecademy.com) or [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse). There are also very good videos and tutorials in Youtube. Just Google the topic you're interested in and give some of those a try.
