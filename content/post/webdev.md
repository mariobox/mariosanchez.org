I consider myself a self-taught **junior web developer**. 

I picked up web development as a **serious hobby** about five years ago, but my interest in and enthusiasm for the web go way back to the late 1990's. Back then, being able to share your thoughts with the world instantly and at virtually no cost was (and *still* is) mind-boggling to me. That was the promise of the Internet and the WWW in their early days. 

Ever since, I've been obsessed with understanding the technologies that make such a feat possible. 

I first started making websites with [Microsoft Frontpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) and hosting them in [Geocities](https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/geocities-archive-netscape-browser-first-web-suburbs-aol/580285/). Then I moved up to registering my own domains and uploading my sites to shared hosting services via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>. Then, at the onset of [Web 2.0](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-web-20/), my focus switched to deploying [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) blogs and learning about <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>. 

Not much later, large platforms that came to be known as *social networks* entered the playing field and started to aggregate Internet traffic at a furious pace. I spent a couple of years getting acquainted with them, but became disillusioned when they morphed into sophisticated [surveillance engines](https://nomasters.io/posts/nonparticipation/) built to spy and profit from their users. 

The **open** and **decentralized** web that I had grown to love had started to die.

Then, at around 2012, I heard a few prominent hackers [talk](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) about something called [static site generators](https://www.sitepoint.com/static-site-generators/), and how they made them rediscover the excitement of publishing a personal website and experimenting with the code. I decided to go back to basics and re-learn the fundamentals of *HTML* and *CSS*. Soon, I was designing web pages from scratch with just a text editor, a blank page and my bare hands. 

I was hooked.

After that, I delved deeply into understanding how static site generators worked, and experimented with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (my current setup). 

I then decided to approach coding and web development in a more structured way, so when I heard about [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), the online coding school, I decided to enroll. It was a great experience. I [completed](https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion) the *Front End Web Development* and *JavaScript* tracks and took courses on a variety of subjects, like *React* and *Node*. 

I then took [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science), the Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard, offered by [edX](https://edx.org), where I learned about algorithms, *C*, *JavaScript* and back-end development with *Python*, *Flask* and *SQL*. In parallel, I also learned *Git* and deployed a few virtual private servers.

As an [introvert](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) with a bias for logic and rational thinking, coding is an activity that matches my personality better than anything else I've tried-I just wish I had discovered it *earlier*. I can sit down and code for hours without ever getting bored. For me, it almost feels like meditation in the sense that when I'm coding I'm engaged 100% and time doesn't seem to pass.

This notwithstanding, I've gone through some periods of discouragement, during which I have stopped coding for a few weeks or months, consumed by doubts about ever becoming good enough to turn coding into a paying job.  

But then I read an [article](https://sivers.org/balance) by Derek Sivers, the gist of which is this: *do something for money, and do your art for its own sake. Don't burden your art with the need to make money from it*. From that day, I've thrown myself back into coding and I've learned something new every day. 

If you're just starting and don't know if coding is for you, take a look at some of the [projects](/project/) and [posts](/post/) on this site, or drop me an email if you have any questions. I may be able to point you in the right direction or let you know what has worked for me.
