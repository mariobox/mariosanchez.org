I've been writing often on this site lately, so I decided to listen to the audio version of [On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060891541) by **William Zinsser**. The book was highly recommended by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org). More than a collection of grammatical rules and techniques, *On Writing Well* is a common sense guide on how to keep your writing concise and engaging. Here are the passages and concepts that resonated with me:

## Writing: Art or Craft?

* Writing is a craft, like carpentry or plumbing. As any craft, it has its tools. The tools of writing are words.
* **Re-Writing** is more important than writing. Writing never comes out right the first time around.

## The Principles of Good Writing

1. Clarity
2. Simplicity
3. Brevity
4. Humanity

### 1. Clarity

* Clarity is the goal in writing.
* The reader must understand *exactly* what you mean.
* Read your sentences aloud to see if they are clear.

### 2. Simplicity

* Remove clutter from your writing.
* Rid your writing of any **pretentiousness**, **pomposity** and **fat**.
* Use simple words: don't use "assistance" when you can say "help". Don't use "I'm congnizant of" when you can say "I know".
* Writing is hard: <mark>easy writing makes hard reading</mark>.

### 3. Brevity

* **Short is better than long**: short sentences are better than long sentences.
* Cut your writing by 50%!
* Things you can cut:
  * Adverbs (loudly, thoroughly, etc.). Most of the time, the verb is enough.
  * Most adjectives.
  * Qualifiers: "sort of", "a little bit", etc.
  * Anouncing what you're about to say: "As you probably may have noticed..."

### 4. Humanity

* **Write the way you talk**. If you don't speak a certain way, don't write it that way.
* Sound like a person.
* You are writing for YOU.
* You don't need to be an expert about a subject. You just need to be interested.
* **Your style is your personality in writing**.
* Don't try to be ornate or pretentious.

## Attitude

* All writers are driven by ego. 
* Self-esteem is important: write about what YOU want.
* If you want to write compelling stories, you need self-esteem.
* Who are you writing for? You!
* Your writing is the gift of **who you are**.

## Discipline

* Many times you won't feel like writing, so you need **strong discipline** and **work habits**.
* The reader has to believe that the writer is feeling good.
* You learn to write by writing.
* There is no right or wrong way to write: some write a full text and then review. Others write one paragraph and re-writes it often before moving to the next.
* There is no right or wrong time to write but you need to **establish a routine** for writing and stick to it.
* Re-writing will give you pleasure.

## How-To Tips

* Writing is **visual**. Good writing catches the eye before it catches the brain.
* Use **plain** words that you can relate to.
* Use **active** verbs: active verbs give momentum to a sentence and helps you picture **who did what**.
* One-syllable active verbs are the best.
* Eliminate passive verbs: they remove the person from the sentence, and force you to come up with a passive noun.
* Use **short**, **simple** nouns that we all know.
* Bad nouns are usually of latin origin: **orientation**, **implementation**, etc. (too long and sound pretentious).
* If you are not an expert on a subject just show **sincerity**.
* To write good English you have to read good English.
* Find role-models and imitate them.
* Write with your "ear": **rhythm**, **cadence**, **musicality** are very important. Read your sentences aloud to see if they sound write.
* If a sentence doesn't "sound" right, re-write it.
* Make sure that your sentences are well connected, otherwise you will lose your reader.

## Information and Narrative

* There is nothing more interesting (and effective) than the truth.
* Don't try to explain what is already clear.
* Sincerity is your most important credential.
* Narratives: everybody loves stories. Tell a story.
* Make ample use of quotes. Quotes are the best way to convey what people think, say or feel.
* Quotes make your writing credible and interesting.
* Learn the skill of interviewing.
* Interview with pen and paper, not a recording device.
* Alternate quotes with your writing.
* A good interviewer has to generate **trust**.
* **Be true to yourself!**
