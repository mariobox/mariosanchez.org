ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mario and I am currently helping students learn **Middle School** and **High School Math**, as well as preparing them for the **SAT Math Test**.

I strive to explain complex subjects in a simple manner, often by way of examples, and to create the conditions so that students overcome their fear of math and enjoy the learning process.ðŸŒ±

### Areas of Expertise

ðŸŽ¯ Arithmetic

ðŸŽ¯ Algebra I

ðŸŽ¯ Algebra II

ðŸŽ¯ Geometry

ðŸŽ¯ Trigonometry

### How This Works

I use **Zoom** for my online classes. Ideally, students will contact me before the class to let me know what subjects they need help with (either the general topics or the specific exercises they want us to review together). 

During our lessons I ensure that students understand the fundamentals behind solutions to problems, so that they can later apply them themselves.
