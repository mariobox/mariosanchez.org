ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mario and I am currently helping students learn **Middle School** and **High School Math**, as well as preparing them for the **SAT Math Test**.

I strive to explain complex subjects in a simple manner, often by way of examples, and to create the conditions so that students overcome their fear of math and enjoy the learning process.ðŸŒ±

### Areas of Expertise

ðŸŽ¯ Arithmetic

ðŸŽ¯ Algebra I

ðŸŽ¯ Algebra II

ðŸŽ¯ Geometry

ðŸŽ¯ Trigonometry

### How This Works

I use **Zoom** for my online classes. Ideally, students will contact me before the class to let me know what subjects they need help with (either the general topics or the specific exercises they want us to go through together). 

During our lessons I will make sure that students understand the fundamentals behind solutions to problems, so that they can later apply them themselves.

### Prices and Packages

ðŸ¥‡**Gold**: Five (5) one hour lessons: $175

ðŸ¥ˆ**Silver**: Three (3) one our lessons: $120

ðŸ¥‰**Bronze**: One (1) one hour lesson: $45

For new students, the first hour is free.

### About Me

I am originally from Peru and have been living in the US since 1989. I am fully bilingual and can conduct my classes in English or Spanish. I have recently retired from the corporate world, where for 30 years I worked in international marketing for large consumer goods companies. I hold Industrial Engineering and MBA degrees. Besides math, my passions are **computer programming** and **soccer**.
