I've decided to start blogging again. 

The "social" web has become a toxic and unhospitable place. Although I quit Facebook years ago, I was still using Twitter. Even before Elon took over, Twitter was already a wasteland with the nuance and civility of a South American soccer stadium, where the extreme left and the extreme right hurl quips and insults to each other 24 hours a day, while everybody else is ignored. Why would somebody want to spend time in such a place?

It's time to bring back the pre-Web 2.0 idea of running our own website: a place where we can share our thoughts without fear of censorship or surveillance, a digital home made of text files that we can take with us wherever we want, mold it to our liking, and let it evolve with us. Let the reboot begin!
