    <p>I have been experimenting with location independence since 2022, staying for periods of several weeks to several months in different places. I usually take pictures of the places I go and post a few of them here.</p>    
    <p>All pictures were taken by me using my phone. The picture gallery is made with JavaScript and some CSS. If you want to build a similar gallery for your site here's <a href="/project/photos/">how to do it</a>.</p>
