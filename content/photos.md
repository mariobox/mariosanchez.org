    <p>I have been spending my last few years in three or four different places each year, a few days in some places, but also stints of a month or so in others. Here are some pictures of places I've been and things that caught my eye (I usually post two or three pictures of each place I travel to). </p>    
    <p>All pictures were taken with my phone. The picture gallery is made with JavaScript and some CSS. If you want to build a similar gallery for your site here's <a href="/project/photos/">how to do it</a>.</p>
