My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and I'm a math tutor and junior computer programmer. 

Since retiring from the [corporate world](https://linkedin.com/in/mariobox) in 2022 I've been experimenting with location independence, maintaining a base in Miami, FL, but living in different cities for several weeks to several months. The cities where I feel most at home are Paris (FR), Raleigh, NC and Lima (PE). I have posted a few pictures [here](/photos).

I am now [tutoring](/tutor) students on math and test preparation. I help middle and high school students with Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry and other math related topics, as well as test preparation for the SAT, ACT and ASVAB math sections.

I have also completed several programming [certifications](/coding#certifications), mainly from the [CS50](https://www.edx.org/cs50) suite of courses (offered online by Harvard University) and [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). 

I have developed [projects](/code) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and R, mostly for personal use, which you can see in my [Github repositories](https://github.com/mariobox). 

 

You can contact me by email at mario (at) mariosanchez (dot) org, or find me in [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mariobox) or [Github](https://github.com/mariobox).
