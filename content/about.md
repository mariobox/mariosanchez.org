My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and I'm a full stack junior developer. 

Since retiring from the [corporate world](https://linkedin.com/in/mariobox) in 2022 I've been experimenting with location independence, maintaining a base in Miami, FL, but living in different cities for several weeks to several months. The cities where I feel most at home are Paris (FR), Raleigh, NC and Lima (PE). I have posted a few pictures [here](/photos).

I am constantly striving to learn more about computing and programming, and have completed several [certifications](/coding#certifications), mainly from the [CS50](https://www.edx.org/cs50) suite of courses (offered online by Harvard University) and [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I also engage in a daily coding practice, to better remember what I learn and to discover new learning opportunities.

I have developed [projects](/code) in both the front end and the back end, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and SQL. I have also deployed web applications to servers on the cloud, among them Digital Ocean and Heroku (where I keep live demos of my projects). I maintain a list of my certifications and projects in my [coding page](/coding).

Aside from my coding activities, I am available for [tutoring](/tutor) in Math and SAT/ACT test preparation. I am also open to business opportunities that match my values and fit my location-independent lifestyle. 

You can contact me by email at mario (at) mariosanchez (dot) org, or find me in [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mariobox) or [Github](https://github.com/mariobox).
