My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and I'm a full stack junior developer. 

Since retiring from the [corporate world](https://linkedin.com/in/mariobox) in 2022 I've been experimenting with location independence, maintaining a base in Miami, FL, but living in different cities for several weeks to several months. The cities where I feel most at home are Paris (FR), Raleigh, NC and Lima (PE). I have posted a few pictures [here](/photos).

Although I had been building static web pages with HTML and CSS since the Geocities era, I started learning real programming languages a few years ago, and immediately discovered that I had a passion for everything related to coding and computers. Since then, I am constantly striving to learn more every day. 

I have  completed several [certifications](/coding#certifications), mainly from the [CS50](https://www.edx.org/cs50) suite of courses (offered online by Harvard University) and [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I also engage in a daily coding practice, to better remember what I learn and to discover new learning opportunities.

I have developed [projects](/code) in both the front end and the back end, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and SQL, most of which you can see in my [Github repositories](https://github.com/mariobox). I have also deployed web applications to servers in the cloud, among them Digital Ocean and Heroku (where I keep live demos of some of my projects). 

Aside from my coding activities, I am available for [tutoring](/tutor) in Math and SAT/ACT test preparation. I am also open to business opportunities that match my values and fit my location-independent lifestyle. 

You can contact me by email at mario (at) mariosanchez (dot) org, or find me in [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mariobox) or [Github](https://github.com/mariobox).
