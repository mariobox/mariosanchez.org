My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and this is my personal website. 

I recently retired from the corporate world, after 30+ years in marketing and international business, and I'm currently experimenting with location independence, living in different cities for periods that go from several weeks to several months. 

I am also pursuing my passion for coding by following a daily coding routine, learning as many languages and technologies as possible, and completing projects and certifications. I am deeply interested in back end web development technologies, databases, and data analysis. I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I am currently focused on learning Python's data science and visualization libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and SQL databases.

Aside from coding I am tutoring in Math and SAT/ACT test preparation, and evaluating business opportunities that match my values and fit my new location-independent lifestyle.
