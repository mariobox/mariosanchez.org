My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion and this is my personal page. I am originally an industrial engineer with and MBA and for the last 30 years I've been working in product management, marketing and sales for large international corporations.

I consider myself a self-taught junior web developer, and the focus of this site is to document that part of my life. 

I picked up coding as a serious hobby about five years ago, but my interest and curiority for the web go way back, to the late 1990's. Back then, the idea that we now had a platform to share our thoughts with the world, instantly and at vitually no cost, was (and still is) mind-boggling to me. From those early days, my obsession with learning everything I can about the technologies that make such a feat possible has only increased. At the beginning, my tools of the trade were a copy of Microsoft Frontpage and a Geocities hosting account. Then I moved up to registering my own domains and uploading my websites to shared hosting accounts via FTP. At this same time I develped an obsesson with SEO and my mission in life became to get my personal site a Pagerank of 6. Then Web 2.0 came along, which meant that I became interested in Wordpress, RSS, and or course, more SEO.

Then, at around 2005 something happened: large, centralized platforms called *social networks* started to appear: first Facebook, then Twitter, then others, and slowly but surely they started to represent a bigger percentage of Internet traffic. The independent, decentralized WWW that we all knew and loved started to die.
