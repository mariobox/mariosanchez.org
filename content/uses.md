These are the tools I'm currently using for web development:

- **Computer**: Toshiba Satellite C55. 4Gb of RAM. Intel Celeron N2830 dual core processor.  It's a little underpowered, but it was cheap (~$250). I bought it a few years ago when I was just beginning to code and it still does the trick, so I haven't bought a new one. If you want to know what kind of computer you need [this article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/which-computer-should-i-buy-how-to-find-the-ipad-chromebook-mac-or-windows-pc-thats-right-for-you/) has very good tips.
- **Operating System**: [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Some of the most significant developments in the world of programming and web development are easily accessible from the Linux command line. A few years ago I decided to take the plunge, ditch Windows and [install Ubuntu Linux](/ubuntu) in my computer. So far so good.
- **Static Site Generator**: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), by far the fastest and most reliable website engine I've ever used.
- **Responsive Framework**: [minimal.css](/css/minimal.css). I created my own style sheet from scratch rather than using Bootstrap, since I didn't need 90% of the functionality. 
- **Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/mariobox). I don't know what I would do without Git. Some advane features can be challenging to grasp, but the basics are pretty straightforward, and you may find yourself using just five or six Git commands most of the time. 
- **Text Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). What text editor to use is perhaps the most fiercely debated question among programmers. I haven't yet met anybody who doesn't like [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com), although the most hard core developers wouldn't be caught dead using something other than [Vim](https://vim.org). I think Microsoft has done a magnificent job with VSC so I use it frequently. For quick edits I sometimes use *Gedit* (comes with Ubuntu) or *Nano*, directly from the terminal.
- **Hosting**: I alternate between [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I am currently hosting this page in Github Pages, but I'm also using a VPS for some project demos that require back end functionality.
- **SSL/TLS** Certificate by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), to serve this site through [HTTPS](../https/). With [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) you now get SSL by default.
