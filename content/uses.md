I've joined the [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) community and created this **/uses** page to list the tools I'm currently using for web development.

- **Computer**: Toshiba Satellite C55. 4Gb of RAM. Intel Celeron N2830 dual core processor.  It's a little underpowered, but it was cheap (~$250). I bought it a few years ago when I was just beginning to code and it still does the trick, so I haven't replaced it. If you want to know what kind of computer you need [this article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/which-computer-should-i-buy-how-to-find-the-ipad-chromebook-mac-or-windows-pc-thats-right-for-you/) has very good tips.

- **Operating System**: [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Some of the most significant developments in the world of programming and web development are easily accessible from the Linux command line. A few years ago I decided to take the plunge, ditch Windows and [install Ubuntu Linux](/ubuntu) in my computer. So far so good.

- **Static Site Generator**: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), by far the fastest and most reliable website engine I've ever used.

- **Responsive Framework**: [minimal.css](/css/minimal.css). I created my own style sheet from scratch rather than using something like Bootstrap, since I didn't need 99% of the functionality. 

- **Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/mariobox). I don't know what I would do without Git. Some advance features can be challenging to grasp, but the basics are pretty straightforward, and you may find yourself using just a few [Git commands](/post/gcs/) most of the time. 

- **Text Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The choice of text editor is one of the most fiercely debated topics among programmers. I haven't yet met anybody who doesn't like [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com), although hard-core developers wouldn't be caught dead using something other than [Vim](https://vim.org). For me, Microsoft's **Visual Studio Code** works like a charm. For quick edits I sometimes use **Gedit** (comes with Ubuntu), or **Nano** when I don't want to leave the terminal.

- **Hosting**: I alternate between [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I am currently using Github Pages, but I'm also operating a VPS for some project demos that require back end functionality.

- **SSL/TLS Certificate**: [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). That lets me serve this site through [HTTPS](../https/). With [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) you now get SSL by default.
