When [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com), a popular Canadian web developer and teacher, noticed that one of the most popular questions he routinely received from followers was what kind of software and hardware he used, he decided to create a [/uses](https://wesbos.com/uses) page. As more and more students and followers started doing the same, Wes created the [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) site, featuring profiles linking to the **/uses** pages of his community.

I've joined the movement and created this **/uses** page. These are the tools I'm currently using for web development.

- **Computer**: Toshiba Satellite C55. 4Gb of RAM. Intel Celeron N2830 dual core processor.  It's a little underpowered, but it was cheap (~$250). I bought it a few years ago when I was just beginning to code and it still does the trick, so I haven't replaced it. If you want to know what kind of computer you need [this article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/which-computer-should-i-buy-how-to-find-the-ipad-chromebook-mac-or-windows-pc-thats-right-for-you/) has very good tips.
- **Operating System**: [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Some of the most significant developments in the world of programming and web development are easily accessible from the Linux command line. A few years ago I decided to take the plunge, ditch Windows and [install Ubuntu Linux](/ubuntu) in my computer. So far so good.
- **Static Site Generator**: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), by far the fastest and most reliable website engine I've ever used.
- **Responsive Framework**: [minimal.css](/css/minimal.css). I created my own style sheet from scratch rather than using Bootstrap, since I didn't need 90% of the functionality. 
- **Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/mariobox). I don't know what I would do without Git. Some advance features can be challenging to grasp, but the basics are pretty straightforward, and you may find yourself using just five or six Git commands most of the time. 
- **Text Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The choice of text editor is one of the most fiercely debated topics among programmers. I haven't yet met anybody who doesn't like [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com), although hard-core developers wouldn't be caught dead using something other than [Vim](https://vim.org). For me, Microsoft's **Visual Studio Code** works like a charm. For quick edits I sometimes use **Gedit** (comes with Ubuntu), or **Nano** when I don't want to leave the the terminal.
- **Hosting**: I alternate between [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I am currently using Github Pages, but I'm also operating a VPS for some project demos that require back end functionality.
- **SSL/TLS Certificate**: [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). That lets me serve this site through [HTTPS](../https/). With [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) you now get SSL by default.
