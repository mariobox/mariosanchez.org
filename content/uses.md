I've joined the [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) community and created this page to list the tools I'm currently using for web development.

- **Computer**: I recently purchased an HP Pavilion x360 with a 14" display. It has an Intel Core i5-1035G1 Processor, 8GB SDRAM, and 256 SSD. I love this laptop. I don't mind the smaller screen since my intention is to maximize portability (while at home, I do most of my web development work in a large monitor anyway).

- **Operating System**: [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Some of the most significant developments in the world of programming and web development are easily accessible from the Linux command line. Microsoft seems to follow the same line of thought and recently introduced WSL2 (Windows Sub-System for Linux 2). This feature basically offers you to open a full Ubuntu Linux kernel from within Windows. WSL2 is not just a translation layer, but a full Linux environment, complete with its own filesystem. I will soon write a post explaining how to install it. Basically, I am now running Ubuntu Linux from within Windows 10.

- **Static Site Generator**: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), by far the fastest and most reliable website engine I've ever used.

- **Responsive Framework**: [minimal.css](/css/minimal.css). I created my own style sheet from scratch rather than using something like Bootstrap, since I didn't need 99% of the functionality. I recently updated it to give me the option to toggle between a light and a dark theme.

- **Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/mariobox). I don't know what I would do without Git. Some advance features can be challenging to grasp, but the basics are pretty straightforward, and you may find yourself using just a few [Git commands](/post/gcs/) most of the time. 

- **Text Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The choice of text editor is one of the most fiercely debated topics among programmers. I haven't yet met anybody who doesn't like [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com), although hard-core developers wouldn't be caught dead using something other than [Vim](https://vim.org). For me, Microsoft's **Visual Studio Code** works like a charm. For quick edits I sometimes use **Gedit** (comes with Ubuntu), or **Nano** when I don't want to leave the terminal.

- **Hosting**: I alternate between [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I am currently using Github Pages, but I'm also operating a VPS for some project demos that require back end functionality.

- **SSL/TLS Certificate**: [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). That lets me serve this site through [HTTPS](../https/). With [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) you now get SSL by default.
