This project is part of the CS50W Web Applications with Python and JavaScript online course.

It doesen't use models, just views and templates, to build a wiki page. The program reads through a folder with entries written in Markdown, converts them to HTML and sends them to Django templates to display the pages. You can edit and delete posts, and also use a built-in Search function. Here is a short video of the final product:
