This project is part of the [CS50W Web Applications with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) online course.

It doesn't use models, just views and templates, to build a wiki page. The program reads through a folder filled with entries written in Markdown, converts them to HTML and sends the HTML to Django templates. 

The specs call for:

* A home page that lists the titles of all the entries and links to each individual entry page
* Search functionality
* Random page generator
* The ability to edit entries
