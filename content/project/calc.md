Project involved creating the calculator interface with HTML and CSS and then adding fuctionality through event handlers and callback functions. It works fine, with some improvements yet to be made, like limiting the display to a certain number of digits so that they fit in the calculator window when the number is too large.


You can try it out here:

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
